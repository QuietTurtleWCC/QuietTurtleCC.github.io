<p>Today I finished my recipe book website project that uses the anchor
reference to link my website to outgoing websites and to different
sections. I learned that the strong reference is to represent bold in
the text. I set different colors to different parts of the text by
creating different style rules like giving the color red to recipe
titles with a class style rule and set the background color in the body
tag. </p>

<p>Today I am doing my blog website project using what I the diffrent
font related refrences that I had learned. The plan is to focus on the
text first then mess around with customizing the page with style rules
and to see how that goes with the text. I do not want the page to just
be black and while so I will add some color to it. </p>
